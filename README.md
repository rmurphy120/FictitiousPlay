<h1>FictitiousPlay</h1>
<p>Algorithm to solve for an exact Nash equilibrium of a zero-sum 
markov game. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_play" target="_blank">wiki page</a> 
has some more information about theoretical guarantees. Set up for 
two games, both of which have support for multiple board dimensions, multiple action spaces, and stochastic transition
functions.</p>
